<p class="description">
	In this section you have the opportunity to provide us ideas on how we should prepare the results of this survey,
	which areas we should further explore, what we should focus on in the future, etc.
	This will enable us to better tailor our activities on adaptation and transport and to provide additional benefits for EEA member states.
